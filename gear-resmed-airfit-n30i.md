### > FIELD_REPORT: THE_HOLLOW_FRAME_PROBLEM
The ResMed N30i is an engineering marvel that fails at the **Physical Interface Layer**. By routing the air through a hollow silicone frame that doubles as the "Headgear," ResMed has introduced a critical point of failure for the restless sleeper.

#### ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS: "THE SLIP-ZONE"
1. **The Accordion Failure:** The rear strap is a simple elastic band with an "accordion" fold. While comfortable, it provides zero vertical stability. In a restless sleep cycle, the top-of-head swivel acts as a "Lever Arm," pulling the mask up and away from the nose.
2. **Nasal Cradle Displacement:** Unlike masks that "cup" the nose, the N30i "cradles" it. From a Systems Engineering perspective, this is a **Low-Tolerance Interface**. If the frame moves even 3mm due to pillow friction, the seal breaches, causing an "Air Jet" event that wakes the user.

#### PROPOSED_PATCH (REDESIGN_REQS)
* **Rigid Rear Spine:** The elastic strap should be replaced with a semi-rigid "Halo" to prevent the frame from sliding forward.
* **Friction-Lock Frame:** The silicone frame sections that pass over the temples should have a higher-friction texture to "bond" with the user's skin/hair.

### > THE_VERDICT
**STATUS:** [ ARCHIVE_FOR_STATIONARY_USERS_ONLY ]  
**SUMMARY:** Brilliant "Pneumatic Routing," but the "Mechanical Fastening" is insufficient for high-movement personas. A secondary aftermarket "Strap Sock" is almost mandatory for 100% uptime.
