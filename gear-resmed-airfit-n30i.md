### > SYSTEM_RATING
| Metric | Score | Technical Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PNEUMATIC_FLOW** | 9/10 | Dual-sided frame ensures air delivery even if one side is compressed. |
| **FIELD_OF_VISION** | 10/10 | Zero-obstruction design; optimal for "Observational" tasks (Reading/TV). |
| **STABILITY_LOGIC** | 2/10 | "Accordion" strap fails to maintain tension against lateral movement. |
| **SEAL_RECOVERY** | 4/10 | Once breached by movement, the cradle rarely self-aligns. |
| **V64_COMFORT_INDEX** | 8/10 | Minimalist footprint; low "claustrophobia" variables. |

**TOTAL_SYSTEM_STABILITY: 66%**

### > FIELD_REPORT: THE_HOLLOW_FRAME_PROBLEM
The ResMed N30i is an engineering marvel that fails at the **Physical Interface Layer**. By routing the air through a hollow silicone frame that doubles as the "Headgear," ResMed has introduced a critical point of failure for the restless sleeper.

#### ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS: "THE SLIP-ZONE"
1. **The Accordion Failure:** The rear strap is a simple elastic band with an "accordion" fold. While comfortable, it provides zero vertical stability. In a restless sleep cycle, the top-of-head swivel acts as a "Lever Arm," pulling the mask up and away from the nose.
2. **Nasal Cradle Displacement:** Unlike masks that "cup" the nose, the N30i "cradles" it. From a Systems Engineering perspective, this is a **Low-Tolerance Interface**. If the frame moves even 3mm due to pillow friction, the seal breaches, causing an "Air Jet" event that wakes the user.

#### PROPOSED_PATCH (REDESIGN_REQS)
* **Rigid Rear Spine:** The elastic strap should be replaced with a semi-rigid "Halo" to prevent the frame from sliding forward.
* **Friction-Lock Frame:** The silicone frame sections that pass over the temples should have a higher-friction texture to "bond" with the user's skin/hair, preventing the swivel from pulling the mask out of alignment.

### > THE_VERDICT
**STATUS:** [ ARCHIVE_FOR_STATIONARY_USERS_ONLY ]  
**SUMMARY:** Brilliant "Pneumatic Routing," but the "Mechanical Fastening" is insufficient for high-movement personas. A secondary aftermarket "Strap Sock" is almost mandatory for 100% uptime.
