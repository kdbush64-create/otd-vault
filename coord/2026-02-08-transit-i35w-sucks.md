**DATE:** 2026-02-08
**MODE:** Highway
**PRIMARY_ROUTE:** I-35W southbound
**CHOKE_POINT:** from I-35S @Golden Triangle all the way to I-820.  And again before Belknap all the way to I-30 exit 
**TXDOT_STATUS:** Design Flaws

---

### EQUIPMENT_OR_ROAD_SURVEY
**COMFORT_LEVEL:** 2/10
**SAFETY_RATING:** 1/10

OBSERVATION: Hundres of millions of dollars spent on improving I-35 only to create a worse traffic nightmare than previously existed.  New Toll Lnaes cost $14 for a 4 mile stretch of road to avoid the choke points.  At rush hour Toll lanes slow to a crawl as well.
