# TRANSIT_LOG: Downtown Ft Worth from N Tarrant County
**DATE:** 2026-02-08
**MODE:** Highway
**PRIMARY_ROUTE:** I-35W southbound
**CHOKE_POINT:** from I-35S @Golden Triangle all the way to I-820.  And again, before Belknap, all the way to the I-30 exit 
**TXDOT_STATUS:** Design Flaws

---

### EQUIPMENT_OR_ROAD_SURVEY
**COMFORT_LEVEL:** 2/10
**SAFETY_RATING:** 1/10

OBSERVATION: Hundreds of millions of dollars spent on improving I-35 only to create a worse traffic nightmare than previously existed.  New Toll Lanes can (and do) cost $14 for a 4-mile stretch to avoid the choke points.  At rush hour, Toll lanes slow to a crawl, too.

SUMMARY: Gov Abbott should investigate how this flawed design failed to account for heavier traffic and appears to have been designed for less traffic, and all of TX_Dot needs to be fired.  Everyone should [file a complaint with TxDOT](https://www.txdot.gov/about/contact-us/complaints.html)

### THE_VERDICT
>**FINAL_ANALYSIS:** Avoid I-35 at all costs from Northlake to Burleson
