### THE MISSION
In an era of algorithmic noise and "sponsored content," **The Watch Tower** serves as a singular point of signal. My objective is simple: to provide a technical and culinary vault for the modern Texan and the wandering traveler.

### THE OPERATOR
I am a lifelong observer of the Texas landscape, currently operating out of **North Fort Worth**. While the days of constant global transit are behind me, the mission remains active. My field reports primarily cover the **Texas Triangle** and neighboring states, with occasional long-range deployments to **Europe** for international culinary and gear evaluation.

### THE STANDARDS
Every review, coordinate, and recipe housed in this vault is vetted against three primary protocols:
1. **Practicality:** If it doesn't work in the field or the kitchen, it doesn't belong here.
2. **Independence:** I do not accept "freebies" in exchange for praise. If a piece of gear fails, it is documented as **FUBAR**.
3. **Heritage:** Respect for the roots—whether in a North Texas kitchen or a European bistro—with an eye on future durability.

### PARTNERSHIP PROTOCOLS
I am willing to evaluate products or services provided for review, but only under the following conditions:

* **Unfiltered Output:** I provide a 100% honest opinion. If a product is just "good," I will say so. If it fails, the vault will reflect that.
* **Confidence Check:** Only send items if you are fully confident in your product’s performance under field conditions.
* **Inquiries:** To discuss a potential evaluation or partnership, initiate a secure transmission using the **Inquiry Submission Form** below.

The information here is my own. It is unfiltered. It is tested.

**Welcome to The Vault.**
