# FIELD_REPORT: THE_STOCKYARDS_STAPLE
**STATUS:** OPTIMAL_PROTEIN_INTAKE
**LOCATION:** Fort Worth Stockyards

Most people come here for the show; I come here for the sear. In an age of "fusion" steaks topped with things that don't belong on a cow, this place remains a sanctuary. 

> **THE VERDICT:** No QR code menus. No loud music. Just a heavy knife and a steak that speaks for itself.
> **RATING:** 5/5 SIGNAL_STRENGTH
