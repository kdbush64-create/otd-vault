# LOG: SYSTEM_AUDIT_PROTOCOL (GRP)
**VERSION:** 1.2  
**AUTHOR:** DeWayne Bush, MSITM  
**SUBJECT:** Standardized Grading & Affiliate Disclosure

---

### > AFFILIATE_DISCLOSURE
To maintain the **Observation Deck** without external ads, this system utilizes affiliate links. If you purchase gear through these links, I may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.

**WHY_NO_AMAZON?** I prioritize retailers and brands that offer superior value, logistics, or engineering support over mass-market convenience.

**THE_PROMISE:** I do not accept payment for positive reviews. No brand owns my opinion. If it's junk, the log will reflect it.

### > THE SCORING MATRIX
Every product reviewed under **GEAR_RECON** is subjected to a 10-point audit across five key vectors. A "10" is "Enterprise-Grade Reliability."

**BUILD_QUALITY:** Structural integrity, material choice, and manufacturing tolerances.
**OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY:** Performance under real-world stress.
**V64_COMPATIBILITY:** Integration into a "Vintage64" workflow (Repairability, Ease of Setup).
**ERGONOMICS / UI:** The human-to-machine interface (Buttons, Straps, Software UX).
**VALUE_INDEX:** ROI based on MSRP vs. Lifecycle.

---

### > THE "V64_STABILITY" SCORE
The final percentage is a weighted average of the vectors above.

**MISSION_CRITICAL:** [ 90-100% ] - Superior engineering; highly recommended.
**OPERATIONAL:** [ 70-89% ] - Solid performance; minor design flaws.
**DEGRADED:** [ 50-69% ] - Design-scope mismatch; requires user "patches."
**SYSTEM_FAILURE:** [ Below 50% ] - Not recommended for field use.

---

### > BRAND_ENGAGEMENT_POLICY
**UNFILTERED_TRUTH:** If a system fails, the log reflects the failure.
**ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS:** I provide technical "patches" (design feedback) for engineering teams.
**FIELD_TESTING:** Products are tested in Texas environments for a minimum of 14 days.
