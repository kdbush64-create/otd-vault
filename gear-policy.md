# LOG: SYSTEM_AUDIT_PROTOCOL (GRP)
**VERSION:** 1.1  
**AUTHOR:** DeWayne Bush, MSITM  
**SUBJECT:** Standardized Grading Criteria for GEAR_RECON

---

### > THE SCORING MATRIX
Every product reviewed under **GEAR_RECON** is subjected to a 10-point audit across five key vectors. A "10" is not perfection; it is "Enterprise-Grade Reliability."

| Vector | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **BUILD_QUALITY** | Structural integrity, material choice, and manufacturing tolerances. |
| **OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY** | How well the device performs its primary function under stress. |
| **V64_COMPATIBILITY** | Integration into an "Old Texas Dude" workflow (Linux support, repairability, ease of setup). |
| **ERGONOMICS / UI** | The human-to-machine interface (straps, buttons, software UX). |
| **VALUE_INDEX** | The ROI (Return on Investment) based on MSRP vs. Lifecycle. |

---

### > THE "V64_STABILITY" SCORE
The final percentage is a weighted average of these vectors.
* **90-100%:** [ MISSION_CRITICAL ] - Superior engineering; highly recommended.
* **70-89%:** [ OPERATIONAL ] - Solid performance; minor design flaws.
* **50-69%:** [ DEGRADED ] - Significant design-scope mismatch; requires user "patches."
* **Below 50%:** [ SYSTEM_FAILURE ] - Not recommended for field use.

### > BRAND_ENGAGEMENT_POLICY
1. **Unfiltered Truth:** I do not accept "paid-for" positive reviews. If a system fails, the log will reflect that failure.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** I don't just complain; I provide technical "patches" (design feedback) for your engineering teams.
3. **Field Testing:** No "out of the box" reviews. Products are tested in real-world Texas environments for a minimum of 14 days.
