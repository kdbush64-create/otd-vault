# LOG: SYSTEM_AUDIT_PROTOCOL (GRP)
**VERSION:** 1.1  
**AUTHOR:** DeWayne Bush, MSITM  
**SUBJECT:** Standardized Grading Criteria for GEAR_RECON

---

### > THE SCORING MATRIX
Every product reviewed under **GEAR_RECON** is subjected to a 10-point audit across five key vectors. A "10" is not perfection; it is "Enterprise-Grade Reliability."

**BUILD_QUALITY:** Structural integrity, material choice, and manufacturing tolerances.

**OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY:** How well the device performs its primary function under stress.

**V64_COMPATIBILITY:** Integration into an "Old Texas Dude" workflow (Linux support, repairability, ease of setup).

**ERGONOMICS / UI:** The human-to-machine interface (straps, buttons, software UX).

**VALUE_INDEX:** The ROI (Return on Investment) based on MSRP vs. Lifecycle.

---

### > THE "V64_STABILITY" SCORE
The final percentage is a weighted average of the vectors above.

**MISSION_CRITICAL:** [ 90-100% ] - Superior engineering; highly recommended.

**OPERATIONAL:** [ 70-89% ] - Solid performance; minor design flaws.

**DEGRADED:** [ 50-69% ] - Significant design-scope mismatch; requires user "patches."

**SYSTEM_FAILURE:** [ Below 50% ] - Not recommended for field use.

### > BRAND_ENGAGEMENT_POLICY
**UNFILTERED_TRUTH:** I do not accept "paid-for" positive reviews. If a system fails, the log will reflect that failure.

**ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS:** I don't just complain; I provide technical "patches" (design feedback) for your engineering teams.

**FIELD_TESTING:** No "out of the box" reviews. Products are tested in real-world Texas environments for a minimum of 14 days.
