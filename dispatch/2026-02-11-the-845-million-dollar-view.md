### > THE_OBSERVATION
Fort Worth leaders just locked in a massive **$845 million** plan for the May election. This is the city’s big "to-do list" for the next few years, and it's expensive.

Here’s the breakdown of where they want to put your money:
* **$511.5 million** to fix crumbling streets and keep traffic moving.
* **$10 million** for affordable housing (they doubled this at the last minute because the housing market is moving too fast).
* **$10.8 million** for public art—which is a mandatory "tax" of 1% on construction projects.

Most people see the big numbers. I'm looking at what these choices say about our priorities.

[//]: # (STRATEGY_NOTE: Keep the tone focused on the 'Observer'—not picking sides, just pointing out the logic of the spend.)

### > ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS
Think of this bond package like a major home renovation. We’ve ignored the leaky roof (our streets) for so long that it now costs half a billion dollars just to dry things out. 

The argument over **public art** is the perfect example of our city’s identity crisis. Do we spend $10 million on statues and murals to look like a "modern city," or do we put that money into the sidewalks so people can actually walk to the store? 

The late boost in **housing funds** shows the city is playing catch-up. They realized the "foundation" of where people live is cracking, and they’re trying to throw money at the problem before it gets completely out of hand.

### > THE_V64_VERDICT
>**FINAL_ANALYSIS:** You can't enjoy the view from the porch if the stairs are rotting out; we’re trying to build a fancy future on top of a neighborhood that needs a basic tune-up.
