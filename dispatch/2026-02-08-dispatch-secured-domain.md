### > THE_OBSERVATION
Today I secured our domain name for the OTD site.  https://www.v64otd.com
### > ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS
It is necessary to have a domain name to get a web page out to the masses.  I am excited about this little step to providing unfiltered reviews to my neighbors.

### > THE_V64_VERDICT
>**FINAL_ANALYSIS:** I like what I am doing, this site will grow in features.  My idea is once it is up and running, I will be able to tag businesses, politicians, organizations about their reviews being online and they can come look at it.
>I hope to get this to the point soon where we can have afflilate links who will offer my readers discounts and businesses can offer something to my readers.
