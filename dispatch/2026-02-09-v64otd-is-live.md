### > THE_OBSERVATION
v64otd.com is now live.  Final coding changes made to accept email, email hosting, and web hosting all finalized. 

### > THE_V64_VERDICT
>**FINAL_ANALYSIS:** I am very happy to have gotten to this point.  I plan to providing updates from around DFW as my travels take me. I will review place and destinations, modes of transportation, products that I use on a regular basis and just try to grow this thing organically. I hope to have FaceBook and X pages built soon so that when I make a review, I can tag the company, or place so they can see and respond if it warrants it.
